2) You are given a text string.<br>
Write a PHP function that checks if the string contains any duplicate (two or more) elements and shows summary as list of symbols from text string, ordered by number of duplicates, descending.<br>
If number of duplicates for some symbols are the same, they should be sorted alphabetically, backward.<br>
Example:<br>
- input: aabccddaeee<br>
- output:<br>
- e = 3<br>
- a = 3<br>
- d = 2<br>
- c = 2<br>
- b = 1<br>
